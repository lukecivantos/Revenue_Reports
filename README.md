# Revenue_Reports
DEPRECATED - This is a fairly simple Python script that takes a txt file with the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' recent transactions downloaded from authorize.net and formats it into an excel sheet. Prior, the Ticket Sales Managers would go through each transaction and categorize them one-by-one. I wrote this fairly quickly in 2016 partially because I didn't feel like going through every ticket sale and partially to practice my Python. In early 2018, I realized the new ticket sales managers were uncomfortable running the file from the command line. As another exercise, I revisited the file and created a Flask app (now located in my ReportInterface file) to make Revenue Reports more streamlined in years to come.
